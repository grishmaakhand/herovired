      Photography
    </h1>
    <p>
      Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either
      electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as
      photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business,
      as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass
      communication.[1]

    <h1>Videography</h1>
    <p>
      Videography is the process of capturing moving images on electronic media (e.g., videotape, direct to disk
      recording, or solid state storage) and even streaming media. The term includes methods of video production and
      post-production. It used to be considered the video equivalent of cinematography (moving images recorded on film
      stock), but the advent of digital video recording in the late 20th century blurred the distinction between the
      two, as in both methods the intermediary mechanism became the same. Nowadays, any video work could be called
      videography, whereas commercial motion picture production would be called cinematography.
